# market-state-detector
A small automation tool that detects high-uncertainty market regimes using simple price behavior metrics.  It automates checks that can be done manually (volatility, gaps, ranges) to help avoid decisions during unstable market conditions.  This is not a trading system, not day trading, and not predictive — it’s market monitoring.
